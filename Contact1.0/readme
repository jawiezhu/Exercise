1. The function MODIFY and DELETE has some bugs.
2. The code is too redundancy, no efficient.


What I learned in this code:
(1) How to write or read some files.
(2) The different of text file and binary file.
(3) How to use write() read() seekg() tellg().
(4) The array should be initialized.
(5) Pay attention to page 768 of C++ Primer Plus.
